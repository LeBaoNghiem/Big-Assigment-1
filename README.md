My First Programing Projetct

This is my very first coding project as a beginner programmer.  
It was created as a school assignment, but I consider it the official start of my programming journey.

1. Description:
   The project involves basic C++ programming concepts such as:
   - Using loops, conditions and pointers.
   - Array, dynamic memory allocation, string and vector.
   - File IO using stringstream.
   - Fundamental OOP concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, and separation of concerns
2. Though it's simple, it ’s the result of everything I’ve learned during my **first year at university**,  
especially my journey through **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
